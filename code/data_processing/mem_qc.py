        Perform quality control (QC) checks on the submission data to validate its accuracy and completeness.

        Parameters:
            threshold (float): The minimum acceptable accuracy percentage for a condition.
                            Conditions with accuracy less than or equal to this value will trigger CATEGORY 2.
            TS (bool): Is this task switching?
        Returns:
            CATEGORY -> int: The category of data quality.
                - CATEGORY = 1: Data is within acceptable limits.
                - CATEGORY = 2: At least one condition has accuracy <= threshold.
                - CATEGORY = 3: At least one condition has accuracy == 0% or contains unreported data.
            accuracy -> dict: Accuracy by condition
                - Condition: The block or condition
                - Accuracy: float with accuracy for the block/condition
        Steps:
            1. Check if the number of rows in the submission is within 5% of the expected range (137-153 rows).
            - Raises ValueError if this condition is not met.
            2. Retrieve information on trials reaching the maximum response time (MAXRT), including:
            - The number of trials exceeding MAXRT.
            - The maximum number of consecutive trials exceeding MAXRT.
            - The ranges of consecutive trials exceeding MAXRT.
            3. Calculate accuracy for each condition in the data:
            - Set CATEGORY = 2 if any condition has accuracy <= threshold.
            - Set CATEGORY = 3 if any condition has accuracy == 0%.
            4. Identify problematic conditions where data is missing or incorrectly reported:
            - Set CATEGORY = 3 if any problematic conditions are found.
